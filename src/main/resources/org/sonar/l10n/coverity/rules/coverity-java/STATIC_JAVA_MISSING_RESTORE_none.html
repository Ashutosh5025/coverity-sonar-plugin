Handles classes of flow where a function is either saving some external value, modifying the external value, and then clearly intending to restore it to its original state but failing to do so along one of many paths; or else is checking whether an external has some expected value, modifying the external value, then clearly intending to restore it to the expected value but failing to do so along a path.
