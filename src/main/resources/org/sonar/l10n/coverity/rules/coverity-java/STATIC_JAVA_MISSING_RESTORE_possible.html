Handles classes of flow where a function is either saving some external value, modifying the external value, and then possibly intending to restore it to its original state but not doing so along one of many paths; or else is checking whether an external has some expected value, modifying the external value, then possibly intending to restore it to the expected value but not doing so along a path.  Such code is only incorrect if the intent really was to restore along all paths.
